# Bakery-React
Created with CodeSandbox

This website was created using the React Javascript framework. I deployed the website at the following link:  
https://bakery-react-project.herokuapp.com/  

Here is the GitHub link for the website:  
https://github.com/cpg55850/Bakery-React  

You can also find the codesandbox project online at:  
https://codesandbox.io/s/bakery-react-54kjc  

To compile from source, open the root folder of the project and run "npm install." You will need to have NodeJS installed. Then you can run "npm run start" to begin the dev server.
